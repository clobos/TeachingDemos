<p><font size="2">Dear Greg,<br>
<br>
I was delighted to come across your TeachingDemos package on CRAN and<br>
I used some of the demos for a staff seminar a couple of weeks ago.<br>
We have recently started a couple of new programs, so there were<br>
quite a lot of young recent graduates in the group. I had made a few<br>
additions and changes and made a couple more in response to questions<br>
from participants.<br>
<br>
The first questions were "What graphic?" and "What sliders?" -- these<br>
were folks who'd fired up R for the first time less than an hour<br>
beforehand, indeed part of my agenda was to show them some of R's<br>
graphics capabilities. I've since modified the demos I used so that<br>
an initial graphic and the TK widget are on top when the demo starts.<br>
Unfortunately, that's pretty much incompatible with Hans-Peter's<br>
'slider' function, so lots of direct tcling and tking done.<br>
<br>
The next question was usually "Can we use this with our data?" That<br>
was already poss with several of the functions, and I've tried to<br>
make it possible/easier with more, eg in 'put.points' make the axes<br>
adjust to the data and allow clicking outside the plot area to add<br>
points, and making it poss to extract the results from hist.<br>
(Incidently, I was dumbstruck when I first saw the effect on the<br>
histogram of changing the max and min -- I'd never given that a thought!)<br>
<br>
I wanted to adapt the power demo to use with real data, cos R's<br>
'power.t.test' is a bit pedestrian, and modified it to use the<br>
noncentral t-distribution, since we're usually struggling to squeeze<br>
power out of small samples. But in R 2.3.0, noncentral t throws up<br>
huge numbers of warnings -- even a few with 'power.t.test' itself.<br>
Shoving 'suppressWarnings' in everywhere may be okay for a demo but<br>
not best practice for a 'real' function, so that's on hold for the moment.<br>
<br>
Since these folks were newcomers to R, I put the functions I needed<br>
into a script which, when sourced, creates a pull-down menu from<br>
which default versions can be run. The script is attached.<br>
<br>
A few extras I included: a Law of Large Numbers demo (based on an<br>
idea by Richard Royall &amp; Jeffrey Blume); a Max Likelihood demo with<br>
Poisson - originally so people wouldn't think MLE only applied to the<br>
normal disribution, but actually I found it easier to explain MLE<br>
with Poisson probabilities rather than Gaussian probability density;<br>
a demo which explores the difference between probability and<br>
liklihood; and a PCA demo akin to put.points.<br>
<br>
I added the Poisson distribution and chi-squared to the 'vis...'<br>
series (chi-sq is worth a look as it changes shape so dramatically at<br>
low d.f.!)<br>
<br>
My PCA demo and Prob vs Llh demo are a bit complicated, so I did some<br>
notes to walk folks through them; these have since expanded to a 'lab<br>
guide' covering all the demos I used! Also attached. Background on<br>
the seminar is at <a href="https://mail.ihc.com/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.wcsmalaysia.org/stats/" target="_blank">http://www.wcsmalaysia.org/stats/</a><br>
<br>
I'd be really happy if you could take a look at this and make<br>
comments and suggestions. We plan a follow-up seminar in the fall so<br>
will have an opportunity to revisit these concepts. Also if any of<br>
this is useful for a future version of TeachingDemos, that would be good too.<br>
<br>
Thanks again, both for the TeachingDemos package itself and also the<br>
spur to develop a few additional ideas!<br>
<br>
