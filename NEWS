New in TeachingDemos version 2.3

* etxt* functions updated to use rawToChar(as.raw(0)) rather than '\000'

* new function TkListView for interactively looking at list structures.

* Removed strict dependence on the Tk packages, will only be loaded for functions that use them.

* new function updateusr to update usr coordinate system.

* new function pairs2 that works like the pairs function, but with 2
  matricies and plots the pairwise scatterplots between the matricies.

New in TeachingDemos version 2.2

* tkprogress was removed, use tkProgressBar in utils package (by
  Prof. Ripley) as a better version.

* New function spread.labs to spread coordinates out for adding labels
  to a plot.

For TeachingDemos version 2.1

*  Removed dependence on rgl and tcltk2 packages


New to TeachingDemos version 2.0

* TeachingDemos now has a NAMESPACE so you can access just parts of
  the package without loading everything.  Fewer packages are now
  loaded with it, so it should load smaller and faster.

* Some of the gui demonstrations (e.g. run.cor.examp) were rewritten
  using the tkrplot package so that the graph shows up in the same
  window as the controls.  Old versions will remain, but with the word
  "old" inserted into the name.  More will change eventually.

* Many of the examples sections have replaced \dontrun with
  if(interactive()) so that the examples can be run using the
  "examples" function (recommended to use ask=FALSE).

* clt.demo function will now allow you to specify parameters of the
  distributions and the exponential was replaced with a gamma (the
  defaults match the prior information).

* New function "tkexamp" for creating interactive
  examples/demonstrations of the effect of changing parameter values
  on a graph.

* New functions "dynIdentify" and "TkIdentify" which create a
  scatterplot, place labels on the points, then allow you to drag the
  labels to new locations.

* New function "col2grey" for getting an idea of how a graph will look
  if printed or copied to greyscale.

* New function "SensSpec.demo" to show how to move from Sensitivity
  and Specificity to predictive power positive and negative using an
  intuitive virtual population method rather than the explicit math of
  Bayes formula.

* New functions "TkApprox" and "TkSpline" to interactivly interpolate
  on graphs and find values, differences, derivatives.

* New function "tkprogress" for a popup progress bar window to show
  you how a loop is progressing.

* New functions "txtStart", "etxtStart", etc to create transcript
  files and script files of your session.  Final result is a text file
  or a text file that can be converted to postscript and others via
  the enscript program.  The later version can include copies of
  graphs.
